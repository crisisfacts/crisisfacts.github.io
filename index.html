			<p>CrisisFACTS is an open data challenge that supports research into state-of-the-art temporal summarization technologies 
			that can extract valuable information from online data sources during (crisis-related) events. At its core, CrisisFACTS provides a dataset 
			that enables researchers and practitioners train and evaluate systems for this task, removing the need for individuals to
			perform the expensive process of data collection and labelling. Moreover, it acts as a central hub by which participants 
			can compare approaches to this task in a standardised environment, aiding research in this domain.</p>

					<p class="uk-text-bold uk-text-primary">Temporal Summarization</p>
					<p>Temporal Summarization (TS) technologies are a subset of 
					the wider summarization field that are concerned with 
					how to produce concise timelines for an event of interest.
					They differ from traditional summarization in that they
					focus more about ordering information by time and
					producing a series of short updates rather than producing a longer
					narrative.</p>

					<p class="uk-text-bold uk-text-primary">Use-Case: Crisis Factoid Timelines</p>
					<p>Temporal summarization can be applied in many areas,
					but to facilitate effective evaluation we need to select a use-case
					to target, i.e. who are our summaries for and what do they want?
					CrisisFACTS targets summarization for emergency responders who want
					a concise, accurate and up-to-date summary of a crisis event
					that can be used to inform first responders, decison makers and communication teams.

					<p class="uk-text-bold uk-text-primary">Motivation</p>
					<p>With the wide-spread access to and use of internet-enabled devices, live online 
					reporting and discussion of events of interest has become commonplace across 
					multiple platforms, from traditional to social media. This is a valuable source of
					real-time information about an event that can be used by response services
					to better understand what is happening on the ground during a crisis. Indeed, 
					good situational awareness is critical to enable effective decision making and
					communication during an emergency.

					<p class="uk-text-bold uk-text-primary">The Challenge</p>
					<p>However, making effective use of this information is no easy task. Due to the
					high volumes and rate at which new online content is published, manual analysis is
					often simply impractical. Moreover, content is published in a wide variety of 
					platforms with their own formats and norms, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.
					Hence, there is a need for automatic systems that can quickly analyse all of these
					infromation streams and extract just the key facts for the user.

					<p class="uk-text-bold uk-text-primary">Crisis Factoid Timelines</p>
					<p>Before discussing the task, its critical that we understand what our end-goal is.
					At its core, we are trying to take a large, highly-redundant and noisy set of text 
					documents published over time during an event, extract only the key, unique and useful information,
					and present that information in a time-ordered, concise, self-contained way, whilst
					also providing supporting evidence for the information we serve. As we care about the
					ordering of information, it follows that our output should be items that can appear in
					a timeline. We should avoid reporting the same thing multiple times, and each item should
					be understandable in isolation. To tackle the supporing evidence problem, we should link
					to our sources. We also might want to categorize our items and present only a sub-set of
					them depending on the target audience and their responsibilities. Given these requiements,
					we might envisage producing timelines for an event like the one across:

				<p class="uk-text-bold uk-text-primary">Task Definition</p>
					<p>As a data challenge, we define a task that participants can develop solutions for, which is aligned with the end-goal discussed above. At a high-level,
					the CrisisFACTS task is to take in a <b>series of online content streams</b> for a crisis event, then at a set point in time (summary request time), <b>produce a scored list 
					of timeline items ('facts') based on content published up-to that point</b>. This list should be non-redundant, i.e. it should include only a single 'exemplar' item for each 
					unique piece of information you found. This list of timeline items can then be passed to a report generation system that produces the 
					final event summary for an emergency responder, where higher-scored items are more likely to be included (more on this when we discuss summary length).

					<p class="uk-text-bold uk-text-primary">What is an Output Timeline Item/Fact?</p>
					<p>A timeline item or 'fact' must be comprised of four components, with one optional component depending on the type of your system:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Fact Text</b>: A short single-sentence statement that conveys an important, atomic and self-contained piece of information about the event.</li>
						<li><b>Timestamp</b>: A date and time indicating the earliest point in time that your system detected the fact.</li>
						<li><b>Importance</b>: A numerical score between 0 and 1 that indicates how important your system thinks it is for this fact to be included in the final summary.</li>
						<li><b>Sources</b>: A list of stream item identifiers (more in this in datasets) that your system beliveve support the fact.</li>
						<li><b>Stream Item Identifier (Optional)</b>: If your system is extractive in nature, i.e. your fact texts are direct copies 
						of text found in the input streams, then the identifier of the input item that the text comes from.</li>

					<p class="uk-text-bold uk-text-primary">Extractive vs. Abstractive Facts</p>
					<p>It is of note that there are two broad strategies one might take when extracting facts, namely extractive or abstractive.
					The dataset that we provide participants is already divided into 'stream items', e.g. sentences from a news article, or the
					text of a tweet.</p>
					<p><b>Extractive approaches</b> may simply consider each of these stream items as candidate facts, and as such treat the
					broader CrisisFACTS task as a stream item filtering and scoring problem, where the goal is to cluster the stream items based
					on the information they contain, select an exemplar from each cluster, and then score each exemplar/cluster by its percieved
					importance.</p>
					<p><b>Abstractive approaches</b> on the other hand aim to generate new custom fact text, using the stream items as input. 
					An abtractive approach might still cluster the stream items based on the information contained, but instead of selecting an
					exemplar from the cluster, it would generate a new piece of fact text using the cluster as input, theoretically producing a
					more concise and targeted fact than extractive approaches.

					<p class="uk-text-bold uk-text-primary">The Problem with Variable Length Summaries</p>
					<p>A core question in any summarization domain is 'how long is a good summary?'. How we answer this question is key for two reasons: 
					1) length is intrinsicly linked to the quality of a summary - we want as short a summary as possible without missing key information;
					and 2) from an evaluation perspective, trying to fairly compare summaries of different lengths is a very difficult problem for which 
					there is no good solution. Most works in summarization simplify by specifying a static length limit (e.g. in words), side-stepping this problem. However, this
					is not an option when summarizing events that last for different lengths of time - as the amount of information we need to capture in
					our summary will similarly vary, nessitating variable numbers of items in our timelines.

					<p class="uk-text-bold uk-text-primary">How does CrisisFACTS Tackle Variable Length Summaries?</p>
					<p>The way that CrisisFACTS works around this challenge is that we ask participants to provide as many unique facts as they can find and 
					think are important as a ranking, i.e. participant system output is variable length. However, at evaluation time, we will convert these
					variable length rankings into fixed-length timelines/summaries, enabling a like-for-like comparison across participants. More precicely,
					at evaluation time based on our ground truth data that we collect manually, we specify a reasonable summary length on a per-event basis.
					What this means is that the more valuable information our assessors find for an event, the longer the target summary length for that event
					will be, and partipants will not know that prior to submission and hence cannot optimise for it.

				<p class="uk-text-bold uk-text-primary">Data Streams</p>

					we divide it into stream items, where each stream item contains a short piece of text and a publishing timestamp and a unique stream item identifier.
